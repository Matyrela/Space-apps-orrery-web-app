    <h3>What is NeoNavigator?</h3>
    <p>NeoNavigator is an interactive Orrery that allows users to explore the planets, moons, and other celestial bodies in our solar system. Our goal is that you learn more about the fascinating world beyond our own.</p>
    <h3>What is an Orrery?</h3>
    <p>An orrery is a model of the Solar System that, according to NASA, "presents the position of celestial bodies, such as planets and Near-Earth Objects (NEOs), relative to the Sun".</p>
    <h3>How to Use NeoNavigator</h3>
    <p>Simply click on the "Start Navigation" button on the home page to begin exploring the Solar System. You can use your mouse to rotate the view, zoom in and out, and click on individual objects to learn more about them.</p>

    <h3>What is a Planet?</h3>
    <p>A planet is a celestial body that needs to follow some criteria to be considered like it.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It needs to orbit a star (in case of our solar system, the Sun).</li>
        <li>It needs to hav a sptherical shape.</li>
        <li>It needs to have cleared its orbit of other objects around the Sun.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What is the Solar System?</h3>
    <p> "The Solar system has one star, eight planets, hundreds of moons, thousands of comets, and more than a million asteroids. 
        Our solar system is located in the Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy with two major arms, and two minor arms.
        We call it the solar system because it is made up of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity." </p>
    <h3>What are Near-Earth Objects?</h3>
    <p> NEOs are comets and asteroids that have been nudged by the gravitational attraction of nearby planets into orbits that 
        allow them to enter the Earth's neighborhood.</p>
    <h3>Inner Planets</h3>
    <p>The first four planets from the Sun are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, also known as terrestrial planets because they have solid surfaces.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mercury: Smallest planet, nearest to the Sun.</li>
        <li>Venus: Earth's closest planetary neighbor.</li>
        <li>Earth: Our home, the third planet from the Sun.</li>
        <li>Mars: Dusty, cold, desert world with a thin atmosphere.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Outer Planets</h3>
    <p>The giant planets in our outer solar system don't have hard surfaces and instead have swirling gases above a core.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Jupiter: Largest planet, could fit 1,000 Earths inside.</li>
        <li>Saturn: Sixth planet, second-largest in our solar system.</li>
        <li>Uranus: Third largest diameter, seventh planet from the Sun.</li>
        <li>Neptune: Eighth and most distant planet.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Dwarf Planets </h3>
    <p> Beyond Neptune, dwarf planets include Pluto, Ceres, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ceres: Largest object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.</li>
        <li>Pluto: Reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006.</li>
        <li>Haumea: Oval-shaped, fast-rotating.</li>
        <li>Makemake: Second-brightest object in the Kuiper Belt.</li>
        <li>Eris: Triggered the debate on the definition of a planet.</li>
    </ul>
